# Aurora Capabilities

Aurora Capabilities provides React components for document computation, composition, recording, redaction, and manifest workflows in the Tabularium AI platform.

It is a host-integrated package. The host provides authentication, API gateway configuration, document/session context, and presentation framing. Aurora service implementations, credentials, customer documents, and live storage URLs are not included.

## Features

- Compute document capability results
- Compose document outputs
- Record and download confirmation, PDF, and TIFF outputs
- Redact document outputs
- Generate and download manifests

## Requirements

- Node.js 22
- npm
- A sibling `aurora_core` checkout, which provides the local `aurora-core` dependency used during development

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Use

The package exports `ComputePanel`, `CompositionPanel`, `RecordPanel`, `RedactPanel`, and `ManifestPanel`, together with their hooks, stores, worker clients, and types.

```tsx
import { ComputePanel, RedactPanel } from "aurora-capabilities";
```

See the exported prop types in [`src/public-api.ts`](src/public-api.ts). The host must supply valid credentials and compatible gateway endpoints.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run test:vitest
npm run typecheck
npm run lint:boundary
npm run build
npm run test:visual
```

`npm run test:visual` requires the configured Playwright browsers.

## Public Repository Notes

Do not commit credentials, authorization headers, SAS tokens, generated build output, test results, coverage, local environment files, live storage URLs, or customer documents. Test fixtures must use non-routable URLs.
